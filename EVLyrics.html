        <h2>Please Spit Out Your Gum</h2>
        <pre>
Before we make a mess
Before we have some fun
Before I smell your breath
Please spit out your gum

Juicy Fruit or 5
I'm glad to be alive
But before the kingdom come
Please spit out your gum

Here into this napkin
I've spit mine out too
The pair of wrinkly pink things
Look like me and you

Before we're neck and neck
Before the clock strikes 1
Before the little death
Please spit out your... 

Don't feed it to my fish 
Don't feed it to the cat 
And if a genie asked my wish 
I'd say for it to not be that 

Stick it underneath the desk 
Or here behind my ear 
A single stick is all that's left 
So chew it till its clear 

Here into this napkin
I've spit mine out too
The pair of wrinkly pink things
Look like me and you

Before we're neck and neck
Before we're tongue and tongue
Before the little death
Please spit out your... 

Gum is something special
It doesn't make you fat 
But tastes a lot like candy 
And everyone likes that

What's yours is mine and vice-versa 
And I think nothing's better 
Than having you go fetch my purse 
And smoking candy cigarettes togeth

Right into this napkin
I've spit mine out too
The pair of wrinkly pink things
Look like me and you

Before we're neck and neck
Before the clock strikes fun
Before the little death
Please spit out your gum 

This pearly wad between us
Its flavor went away the other day 
Before long it tastes like you 
In candy lengerie

Chewing gum for you 
Passing back and forth 
On the count of two 
You swallow mine 
And I swallow yours

Right into this napkin
I've spit mine out too
The pair of wrinkly pink things
Look like me and you

Before we're neck and neck
Before we're tongue and tongue
Before our little death
Please spit out your...

        <h2>The Moon Does the Worm</h2>
        <pre>
Twilight in my backyard
The tiki torches dance
And the moon does the worm, too
In the canal
In tear-away pants

Once the music starts, sing
Cupid and his darts sting
Or is it just the pesky bugs
Spreading this disease of love?

Oh love
We dance

For love is in the air tonight
As it usually is on Fridays
Drinking everything in sight
Dancing till we’re sweating sideways

Oh yeah

Once the pilgrims start to leave
We’ll enjoy a light reprieve
There’s room enough to laugh indoors
Air conditioned, on all fours

Oh love
You drug
I take
You make
Me sing

Embarrassing things…

        <h2>Plain Girl, Fancy Boy</h2>
        <pre>
Songs about songs about movies about music about life…

Life, oh!

Life on the fringes,
Life on the brink.
Life on a motorbike,
Life in the clink.

Singing a song about singing a song about me…

And singing of love that he’d found, instead of in bed, in a chest in a cave in his head

Sucking a song from a flower
The flower is me…

Oh me!

Clinging to fancy devices
I’m pleased with the fine water-ices
And he’s pleased to see

Though fancy the English are plain
In a way which is sweet…

So sweet!

Falling and rising
Metastasizing
Living to die
And dying to sleep

A good plain girl should never share with fancy boys here silence
It won’t be long until the twain are flayed by Satan’s trident
A proper Amish woman lives inside a stone fortress
And never leaves, for that would be blindingly torturous

My intended intended to tend to my every whim
But you were far more tender than he,
When you say I’m the belle of Lancaster County

And once you had my snood you had me nude…

Unzoning in ways that I’ve never unzoned before
And unzoning some more

And feeling the molten burn of the haberdashery…

Zippers unzipped and buttons ripped
Commencing our tryst besides piles of pig shit.
By the pig pen, 
Ain’t nobody in here but us chickens

A good plain girl should never share with fancy boys a sentence
It won’t be long before you’re beggars begging for your penance
A proper Amish woman never leaves without her bonnet
And always ties it twice in case somebody should want it
