        <h2>Please Spit Out Your Gum</h2>
        <pre>
Before we make a mess
Before we have some fun
Before I smell your breath
Please spit out your gum

Juicy Fruit or 5
I'm glad to be alive
But before the kingdom come
Please spit out your gum

Here into this napkin
I've spit mine out too
The pair of wrinkly pink things
Look like me and you

Before we're neck and neck
Before the clock strikes 1
Before the little death
Please spit out your... 

Don't feed it to my fish 
Don't feed it to the cat 
And if a genie asked my wish 
I'd say for it to not be that 

Stick it underneath the desk 
Or here behind my ear 
A single stick is all that's left 
So chew it till its clear 

Here into this napkin
I've spit mine out too
The pair of wrinkly pink things
Look like me and you

Before we're neck and neck
Before we're tongue and tongue
Before the little death
Please spit out your... 

Gum is something special
It doesn't make you fat 
But tastes a lot like candy 
And everyone likes that

What's yours is mine and vice-versa 
And I think nothing's better 
Than having you go fetch my purse 
And smoking candy cigarettes togeth

Right into this napkin
I've spit mine out too
The pair of wrinkly pink things
Look like me and you

Before we're neck and neck
Before the clock strikes fun
Before the little death
Please spit out your gum 

This pearly wad between us
Its flavor went away the other day 
Before long it tastes like you 
In candy lengerie

Chewing gum for you 
Passing back and forth 
On the count of two 
You swallow mine 
And I swallow yours

Right into this napkin
I've spit mine out too
The pair of wrinkly pink things
Look like me and you

Before we're neck and neck
Before we're tongue and tongue
Before our little death
Please spit out your...

        <h2>The Moon Does the Worm</h2>
        <pre>
Twilight in my backyard
The tiki torches dance
And the moon does the worm, too
In the canal
In tear-away pants

Once the music starts, sing
Cupid and his darts sting
Or is it just the pesky bugs
Spreading this disease of love?

Oh love
We dance

For love is in the air tonight
As it usually is on Fridays
Drinking everything in sight
Dancing till we’re sweating sideways

Oh yeah

Once the pilgrims start to leave
We’ll enjoy a light reprieve
There’s room enough to laugh indoors
Air conditioned, on all fours

Oh love
You drug
I take
You make
Me sing

Embarrassing things…

        <h2>Plain Girl, Fancy Boy</h2>
        <pre>
Songs about songs about movies about music about life…

Life, oh!

Life on the fringes,
Life on the brink.
Life on a motorbike,
Life in the clink.

Singing a song about singing a song about me…

And singing of love that he’d found, instead of in bed, in a chest in a cave in his head

Sucking a song from a flower
The flower is me…

Oh me!

Clinging to fancy devices
I’m pleased with the fine water-ices
And he’s pleased to see

Though fancy the English are plain
In a way which is sweet…

So sweet!

Falling and rising
Metastasizing
Living to die
And dying to sleep

A good plain girl should never share with fancy boys here silence
It won’t be long until the twain are flayed by Satan’s trident
A proper Amish woman lives inside a stone fortress
And never leaves, for that would be blindingly torturous

My intended intended to tend to my every whim
But you were far more tender than he,
When you say I’m the belle of Lancaster County

And once you had my snood you had me nude…

Unzoning in ways that I’ve never unzoned before
And unzoning some more

And feeling the molten burn of the haberdashery…

Zippers unzipped and buttons ripped
Commencing our tryst besides piles of pig shit.
By the pig pen, 
Ain’t nobody in here but us chickens

A good plain girl should never share with fancy boys a sentence
It won’t be long before you’re beggars begging for your penance
A proper Amish woman never leaves without her bonnet
And always ties it twice in case somebody should want it

        <h2>You Married an O'Leary</h2>
        <pre>
          You’re a bore
I love you
You snore
I love you anyways
You look dumb
I love you
You’re no fun
I love you anyways

You’re mentally impaired
I love you
You got spiders in your hair
I love you anyways
The dirty underwear
I love it
The cross I bear
I love it 
You’re crying
What to do?
I’m lying
It’s true

This happens every time,
It’s no one’s faults but mine it’s true

Your wardrobe’s expensive
The girdle’s defective
Eccentric designers
The totally blind are

You got your father’s farts
You got your mother’s mouth
They built you with spare parts, didn’t they?
And raised you as a louse
They raised you as a mouse
It’s true

This happens every time,
It’s no one’s faults but mine
This happens every time,
It’s no one’s faults but mine
You’re crying again
I’m trying to extend
My softer side to you
What a monstrous thing to do

I’m kidding
You leave
You’re kidding
You’re pissed 
You’re peaved 
I’m grinning
You kissed
A fool with no king
Perpetually joking
And goading and roasting
A pig
With an apple in its trap
And a stick run through it
Front to back

My love language is joking around, receiving gifts, and skipping town. 
And yours are ellipses
Dot dot dot…
Well it’s your fault
It’s your fault
You married an O’Leary

        <h2>Spring's Awakening</h2>
        <pre>
It hit me like a bolt of lightning
The way the wind gets under your clothes
I shall savor every moment of the secret thrill of letting go

How the water gets into your shoes
How the wind sings around your ears
How your heart thumps
How the puppy humps 
Through the years 
All your tears may be wiped
And your fears? They’re silly childish things
I was touched at a local performance of Frank Wedekind’s Springs Awakening

Who invented gunpowder?
Berthold Schwartz, now long dead
I wish he hadn’t
You would’ve hung yourself instead

Who invented abortion pills?
Or the parallellepipidon?
God invents everything which kills and and carries on

Is the future milk pudding, cinnamon sugar?
Or cyanide jelly beans?
Secret lovers making love
We hang as ghosts, spying
On everyone who’s crying or trying to
Memorials are for the living
I learned as much at a local performance of Frank Wedekind’s Springs Awakening

        <h2>My Life as a Sponge-boy</h2>
        <pre>
When I was a young boy 
I lived in a castle
On the coast of Otranto
An orphan named Tonto

My life as a sponge boy
I lived off coffee and cake
Attending to a rake
Who you could say knew his tastes 

He’d ring for his pot
Just before he shot
Into a sponge swollen with the 
sorrow

Purple and pink ones
Dry ones and dripping ones
With textured more varied than skin 

In the summer in the sun
He would fondle, he would thumb
The porous pretties
In the square of the city

I would reek like brine
He’d remark that iss fine 
The room would smell of lavender and thyme all the time

I would leap
From the clips
Like a fish
Through the sea
And I would see the sponges and anemone 
Not doing anything 
Good for one thing

Count the sponges in jars
Sponges at liberty
Some he would drain
Some he’d abstain
Ones that he’s cling to
Ones that he’d fling through the window 
Back into the sea
And ones that he’d fling at me

And then one day I was a man
I washed the trophies
In a frightening punch bowl with some fungi 
And I stirred it all up with his personal scythe 
He made with the buggers and soon was found not alive

The doctor left, the executor came and he told me
That every thing had been left in my name, poor family
Everything, everything except 
Those little creatures he’d collect

His mausoleum lies 15 stories beneath my castello
His casket filled with salt, his mouth with cookie dough, and his ass with every single sponge he’d come to pass
And soon, I took down every pickled punk
Hid ‘em well
Covered up the funk and thereupon opened up a hotel

        <h2>The Sorrows of Alão</h2>
        <pre>
All alone 
In Brasilia
In Brazil
Take a million
Sleeping pills
Kill kill, kill yourself

Being alone in Brasilia
Is a sign you’re reptilian
In the eyes of Brazilians
Kill kill kill yourself and everyone

Brazil, Brazil, Brazil I love you Brazil
You can’t be alone in Brazil
Or you die, no lie

Brazil, Brazil, Brazil
Why do I cry?

I came only to find true love
To f*ck the girl from Ipanema
I go from green, to white, to red
I curse my life and go to bed

It’s a lie what they sell you
Not every guy can just fly to
Belarus or Bangkok
I flew to Brazil with shame, but

Brazil, Brazil, Brazil
I love you Brazil
You can’t be alone in Brazil
Or you die

Brazil, Brazil, Brazil euch
I hate you Brazil
I can’t live in Brazil
So I cry and die

        <h2>Kid's Today</h2>
        <pre>
Babies nowadays are born more cynical than spiders
With an inborn knowledge of using lighters starting fires and slashing tires
And with a mouth that they found in the dustbin
This kid is cussing

Kids today are bearded bodybuilding, polymaths 
With tattoos on their backs of Winnie the Pooh in a night cap 
In the trap cooking crack while they’re just talking smack all day 
get this kid on O&A

The kids I work with have foregone all earthly cares
Some have themselves go
Some have shorn their hair
Tying to the flagpole
Their underwear
For the world they do know
Is one big lair
And God’s a teddy bear that swears

I said did you just say what I think you just said but

Kids today, write the rules
It should be the parents who are the ones in school
It should be the young who drown the world not you

These kids are sick
