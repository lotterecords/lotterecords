      <h2>Launching Lotte</h2>
      <div class="date">Tuesday, June 10, 2025</div>
      <p>Good evening. <br>
        <br>
        Where I am, on the east coast, its almost thirty minutes to midnight, which means its almost the eleventh, which, this time around, means its almost Wednesday. The weather was fine today, but I stayed inside, coding HTML and sticking my finger into GitHub's repositories, and now my finger stinks, but the website is almost up! DNS stuff is getting in the way, so me and her are making small talk, and I'm blogging to mask my annoyance. Her Uber must have flipped. I go back and forth refreshing, but these things aren't for you. These are the dirty things IT guys have to do to make their nut, in addition to scraping dried flecks of old coffee off their lanyards, dusting CPUs, and applying Dude Wipes to the pale undersides of their gynecomastias. <br>
        <br>
        The website is to be the repository of all my little things, all these things that I do that I keep to myself, because they're not for anybody, but everyone, I wish, would devour each and every little thing I do, except for my family. Now they will be able to. And once I am in what I will elusively call the Square, I will have access to a scanner, and my visual things, just as ill-born as my audible things, will be engraved in the granite. <br>
        <br>
        It is 11:38 PM, and the DNS check is successful! Yes, now lotterecords.com is live, and we can all drink.
