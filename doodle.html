  <h1>Life of an Office Doodle</h1>
  <p>The age of sinecures is dead and gone. Lost too are those days of sunshine, those days when artists were signed by world-eating entertainment conglomerates into deals they loved to resent. The era of insane gatekeeping has arrived. 
<br><br>
    She who desires to eat by the fruits of her creative labors alone must be ready to get down like a shark and cannabalize her baby. The boy with the yoyo must sign his own suicide note if he ever expects to enter the hearts and minds of the world. And the dog who plays dead must stay dead, or else be put down. The truth is, there simply is no collective desire to think or feel, and so there is no economic imperative for the sponsorship of what-would-be-great artists. And so, naturally, even creatively-minded folk who would never be great are crushed by insecurity, born too late to hate their sponsors. These idle doodlers must find employment which, in the final estimate, seems to be just as unproductive as art (in an economic sense), but which is far more a friend of the impatient hand of the money-go-round.
<br><br>
    The way he grabs at himself in his sleep, he doodles at his desk - unconsciously and due to some sublimated desire to live as he thinks he might've in another time, another place, in another body and another society. He can't help himself. He doodles himself to death, while he compiles work-papers and addresses review notes, he looks down and notes that an angel has visited him... it looks a little like Homer Simpson, but more often takes the form of a penguin. 
<br><br>
    So with the help of a Sharpie and a scanner (and underappreciated instrument of expression), this leakage of soul, which is flammable and diffuses throughout any and all office spaces, can be presented. <b>Click on any of the notebooks below and see how one man tried to deal with the sadness of his pale, red-eyed, hunch-backed labor.</b>
<br><br>
    What do these doodles mean? Do they matter? Are they art? Hard to say, but they exist.
