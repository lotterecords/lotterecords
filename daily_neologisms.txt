HomocoNTraIvesemiNESibleVERSmultiJIx, also known as HOCO-NET, is a two-dimensional network of proteins that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell migration and tissue formation. These proteins bind to specific cellular receptors, such as TGF-Î² and BMP receptors, and activate downstream signaling pathways that ultimately control cell migration. HOCO-NET is found in a wide range of cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, and myofibroblast cells, and is essential for the development and maintenance of tissue architecture.

For example, HOCO-NET has been shown to be involved in the formation of bone, where it regulates the migration of osteoblasts and the differentiation of mineralizing elements such as cancellous bone and intercalated cells. HOCO-NET has also been implicated in the development of cardiac tissue, where it regulates the migration of cardiomyocytes and the differentiation of endothelial cells. Overall, HOCO-NET is a versatile molecular regulator that plays essential roles in various tissue types, demonstrating its importance in the development and maintenance of complex biological structures.[0m
